Branches let people work on the same project without getting in each other’s way. Each person can create a branch to add features or fix issues, 
then test and review the work before merging it into the main branch. This keeps the project organized and stable.

Branches also help prevent overwriting work, reduce the risk of adding broken code, and keep the project history easy to follow. 
They make it easier to try new ideas and fix problems while keeping the main branch clean and reliable.
