Using branches helps many engineers work on the same project without disturbing each other’s work.
Each developer can create their own branch to add new features or fix problems. 
They can work safely in this separate space without breaking the main project. When the work is ready, 
it is tested and reviewed before it is added to the main branch. This makes teamwork safer and more organized.

Branches also help prevent common problems. They stop people from accidentally overwriting each other’s work. 
They reduce the chance of adding unstable code to the main project. 
They also keep the project history clear and easy to understand.
With branches, teams can try new ideas, fix mistakes, and keep the main branch clean, stable, and reliable.
